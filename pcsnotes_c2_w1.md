[Class Overview](#classOverview)
[JavaScript](#JavaScript)

This class: Set our own stakes. Decide how hard we want to push ourselves.

<a name="classOverview"></a>
##Overall structure of the class:

###JavaScript

We're going to work on JavaScript basics. Usually you get syntax with concepts, little practical work. But we don't learn as well that way, as by doing things practically -- **goal-driven.**

We have to learn what a programming language is. Treehouse is the way that we'll learn the underlying concepts for what we're doing practically in class.  Going to start by building a menu.

###jQuery

Library of JavaScript code written by someone else. First of two libraries that we'll use.

###Responsive Design

Current start of the art.

* Responsive images.
* Responsive typography.

**Pay attention to the stuff that's the most fun for us.**

###Final Project

Start pulling things together, choose team for final project.

###Bootstrap (another library)

How the pros do it.

##JavaScript

People give away books on JavaScript: <a href="http://jsbooks.revolunet.com/" target="_blank">http://jsbooks.revolunet.com/</a>

One of the best is <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">*Eloquent JavaScript</a>.

In learning JavaScript, look for commonalities with HTML and CSS:

* Delimiters
* Name/value pairs
* Blocks - As in CSS, we'll see blocks, but they're used for different things.
