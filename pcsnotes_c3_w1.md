Syllabus is [here](http://portlandcodeschool.github.io/afe/).

Expect to work two hours at home for every hour in class -- 18 hours total work (class + homework) per week.

In each class, will talk about things in a simple way.

Will do pair programming.

Two tracks of assignments:

1. Personal blog
2. Work for "client"

(Side note: Arcade Fire music video made in HTML5 and JavaScript: http://www.justareflektor.com/)

Client Goals --- USER GOALS --- Developer Goals

In this class, too, we're developing skills in four areas:

1. Technology
2. Tools
3. Team
4. Technique

Learning Objective: Observable skill in each area.  Some are specific to a goal, some not. Because this is a class, some of these are already defined.)

**Mainly CSS and JavaScript.**
Not going to cover HTML any more deeply than we already have (Except HTML forms.) 

Topics to be covered: 

* Going to use callbacks (and learn the difference between a "callback and a "promise.") 
* Asynchronous JavaScript (AJAX). Something set up, but that you don't know when it's going to run.
* Chrome Dev Tools, also Firebug and Selenium (to test websites by recording clicks, actions, etc.).
* Task automation
  * For example, Autoprefixer to automatically apply browser-specific CSS prefixes.
