Here are the books that are currently on my nightstand (and on my iPad, and on the couch, and on the floor, and on the chest of drawers in the bathroom, and all over the rest of the house):

* *Riding the Trail of Tears*, Blake M. Hausman

* *Wedlocked*, Jay Ponteri

* *On Writing Well*, William Zinsser

* *Geek Sublime*, Vikram Chandra

* *Mobile HTML5*, Estelle Weyl

* *Eloquent JavaScript*, Marijn Haverbeke

* *Microinteractions*, Dan Saffer.

* *The Full Catastrophe: Travels Among the New Greek Ruins*, James Angelos.

* *The House on Paradise Street*, Sofka Zinovieff.

* I'm sampling Pulitzer Prize winners and finalists, including:
  * *All the Light We Cannot See* (Anthony Doerr)
  * *Let Me Be Frank With You* (Richard Ford)
  * *The Goldfinch* (Donna Tartt)
  * *A Visit from the Goon Squad* (Jennifer Egan)
  * (More books to explore later are [here](http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Fiction).)

* I'm putting a dent into this list: the [twenty novels](http://martinhillortiz.blogspot.com/2015/04/cwa-mwa-and-mwj-mystery-novels-that.html) that appeared on these three lists of favorite mystery novels, chosen by readers: 
  * The 100 Top Mystery Novels lists from the Crime Writers' Association (British, 1990)
  * The Mystery Writers of America (1995)
  * The two lists of "Western" (American and European) Novels from the Mystery Writers of Japan (1985, 2012).

* I'm also intrigued by many of the titles on [this list from Donald Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/retd.html), and someday when I'm feeling brave, I would like to attempt to read some of Knuth's own writing...
