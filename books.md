Here are the books that are currently on my nightstand (and on my iPad, and on the couch, and on the floor, and on the chest of drawers in the bathroom, and all over the rest of the house):

* *Geek Sublime*, Vikram Chandra

* *On Writing Well*, William Zinsser

* *Mobile HTML5*, Estelle Weyl

* *Eloquent JavaScript*, Marijn Haverbeke

* *Microinteractions*, Dan Saffer.

* *Fluent Forever*, Gabriel Wyner.

* *The Full Catastrophe: Travels Among the New Greek Ruins*, James Angelos.

* *Heap House: Book One (The Iremonger Trilogy)*, Edward Carey.

* *High Five*, Janet Evanovich.

* And even though it's no longer summer, and these aren't books, I'm working my way through [this list](http://alistapart.com/article/summer-reading-issue-2015).
