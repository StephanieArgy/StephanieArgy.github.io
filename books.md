Here are the books that are currently on my nightstand (and on my iPad, and on the couch, and on the floor, and on the chest of drawers in the bathroom, and all over the rest of the house):

Books by my instructors:

* *Riding the Trail of Tears*, Blake M. Hausman
* *Wedlocked*, Jay Ponteri

Books on writing:

* *On Writing Well*, William Zinsser
* *Geek Sublime*, Vikram Chandra

Mysteries/Thrillers:

* *A Coffin for Dimitrios*, Eric Ambler
* *Death in Ecstasy*, Ngaio Marsh

The above two are part of my effort to make a dent in this list: the [twenty novels](http://martinhillortiz.blogspot.com/2015/04/cwa-mwa-and-mwj-mystery-novels-that.html) that appeared on three lists of all-time favorite mystery novels: 

  * The 100 Top Mystery Novels lists from the Crime Writers' Association (British, 1990)
  * The Mystery Writers of America (1995)
  * The two lists of "Western" (American and European) Novels from the Mystery Writers of Japan (1985, 2012).
  * (Next up for me: *The Daughter of Time* (Josephine Tey) and *Trent's Last Case* (Edmund Clerihew Bentley).)

Books on coding:

* *Mobile HTML5*, Estelle Weyl
* *Eloquent JavaScript*, Marijn Haverbeke
* *Microinteractions*, Dan Saffer.

Books on Greece:

* *The Full Catastrophe: Travels Among the New Greek Ruins*, James Angelos.
* *The House on Paradise Street*, Sofka Zinovieff.

I'm also intrigued by many of the titles on [this list from Donald Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/retd.html), and someday when I'm feeling brave, I would like to attempt to read some of Knuth's own writing...
