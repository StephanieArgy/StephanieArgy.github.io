Here are the books that are currently on my nightstand (and on my iPad, and on the couch, and on the floor, and on the chest of drawers in the bathroom, and all over the rest of the house):

* *Riding the Trail of Tears*, Blake M. Hausman (whose class I'm taking starting January 6, 2016)

* *Wedlocked*, Jay Ponteri (whose class I'm taking starting January 10, 2016)

* *On Writing Well*, William Zinsser

* *Geek Sublime*, Vikram Chandra

* *Mobile HTML5*, Estelle Weyl

* *Eloquent JavaScript*, Marijn Haverbeke

* *Microinteractions*, Dan Saffer.

* *The Full Catastrophe: Travels Among the New Greek Ruins*, James Angelos.

* *The House on Paradise Street*, Sofka Zinovieff.

* I'm also sampling some Pulitzer Prize winners and finalists, including *All the Light We Cannot See* (Anthony Doerr), *Let Me Be Frank With You*, (Richard Ford) and *The Goldfinch* by Donna Tartt. (More choices to explore later are [here](http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Fiction).)

* I'm also intrigued by many of the titles on [this list from Donald Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/retd.html), and someday when I'm feeling brave, I would like to attempt to read some of Knuth's own writing...
