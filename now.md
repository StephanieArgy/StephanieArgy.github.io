Inspired by the Now pages of [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) and [Gregory Brown](http://practicingdeveloper.com/now/) and many others, I've created this list of the things I'm working on now -- to be updated regularly as I finish old things and add new ones.  (Most recent update: October, 2015).

* [*A Person Known to Me*](http://www.apersonknowntome.com): An ongoing epic detective adventure that includes prose, movies, historical context and illustrations by the wonderful Kati Simon, all put together in the form of an interactive experience.
* Developing my craft as a writer of prose, mostly fiction, some non-fiction. In addition to the prose elements of *A Person Known to Me*, my top-of-the-pile writing projects at the moment are:
    **The Mesopotamia* - A series of short fiction pieces set in a 1920s Chicago movie palace, to be presented online in the form of an interactive website.
    *"Urban Bird" - A short story about the inventer of the pigeon.
    *A non-fiction account of the final eleven days of my mother's life (though I'm not sure I'll have the courage to finish this one).
* Coding: After delving into assorted frameworks, scaffoldings, preprocessors and task runners, I'm now stripping my technique back down to the basics to master these four things:
    *HTML5
    *CSS3
    *JavaScript/jQuery
    *Responsive and mobile-first design.
    *I'm also transcribing all my notes from the classes I took at Portland Code School and posting them <a href="../pcsnotes/">here</a>.
* Angel Investing: As a [Pipeline Angel](http://pipelineangels.com/), I'm evaluating and investing in for-profit social ventures founded and run by women.
* Learning to speak Greek, learning about Greece.
* A narrative and photographic experiment that looks at different cities from the intersection of physical geography, urban design and architecture.
