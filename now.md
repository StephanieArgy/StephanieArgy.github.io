Inspired by the Now pages of [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) and [Gregory Brown](http://practicingdeveloper.com/now/) and many others, I've created this list of the things I'm working on now -- to be updated regularly as I finish old things and add new ones.  (Most recent update: December 15, 2015).

My main work at the moment is in three areas: Story, Coding, Angel Investing.

##Story

* [*A Person Known to Me*](http://www.apersonknowntome.com): An ongoing epic detective adventure that includes prose, movies, historical context, and illustrations by the wonderful Kati Simon, all put together in the form of an interactive experience.

* A non-fiction account of the final eleven days of my mother's life.

* "Urban Bird" - A short story about pigeons.

* *The Mesopotamia* - A series of short fiction pieces set in a 1920s Chicago movie palace, to be presented online in the form of an interactive website.

* Reading. Here's my <a href="../books/">current list</a>.

    
##Coding
    
After delving into assorted frameworks, scaffoldings, preprocessors and task runners, I'm now stripping my technique back down to the basics to master these four things:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript/jQuery
* Responsive and mobile-first design.

* I'm doing coursework through [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/). (Right now, "Interactive Web Pages with JavaScript.")

* I'm exploring learning paths that others have recommended, including the Resource Guide from the [Grace Hopper Academy](http://gracehopper.com/curriculum) and the [Front End Handbook](http://www.frontendhandbook.com/).
    
* I'm transcribing all my notes from the classes I took at Portland Code School and posting them <a href="../pcsnotes/">here</a>.


##Angel Investing
    
* As a [Pipeline Angel](http://pipelineangels.com/), I'm evaluating and investing in for-profit social ventures founded and run by women. I've collected some of the resources and tools I've found [here](http://stephanieargy.github.io/AngelInvesting/).


##Other Things

* Learning to speak Greek, learning about Greece. (Finding it very useful to work with the [Anki spaced repetition system](http://ankisrs.net/).)

* Learning to be part of the [Portland Neightborhood Emergency Team program](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/pbem/31667?).
