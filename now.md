Inspired by the Now pages of [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) and [Gregory Brown](http://practicingdeveloper.com/now/) and many others, I've created this list of the things I'm working on now -- to be updated regularly as I finish old things finish and start new ones.  (Most recent update: October, 2015).

* [*A Person Known to Me*](http://www.apersonknowntome.com): An ongoing detective adventure that also prose, movies, historical accounts and illustrations by the wonderful Kati Simon.
* Writing: My focus is on developing my ability to write prose, mostly fiction, some non-fiction. In addition to the prose elements of *A Person Known to Me*, my top-of-the-pile writing projects at the moment are:
2. "Urban Bird" - A short story about the inventer of the pigeon.
3. A series of short fiction pieces set in a 1920s Chicago movie palace called The Mesopotamia, to be presented online in the form of an interactive website.
4. A non-fiction account of my mom's last eleven days (though I'm not sure I'll ever have the courage to finish this one).
* Coding: After delving into assorted frameworks, scaffoldings, preprocessors and task runners, my current goal is to strip my technique back down to the basics and focus on HTML, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery, always with responsive design/mobile first at the forefront of what I'm doing.
* Angel Investing: 
* Greek/Greece: In preparation for a trip to the land of my ancestors early next year, I'm studying Greek. (I'm doing this partly on my own, and partly 
* A narrative and photographic experiment that looks at different cities from the intersection of physical geography, urban design and architecture.
