Inspired by the Now pages of [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) and [Gregory Brown](http://practicingdeveloper.com/now/) and many others, I've created this list of the things I'm working on now -- to be updated regularly as I finish old things and add new ones.  (Most recent update: January 12, 2016).

My main work at the moment is in three areas: Story, Coding, Angel Investing.

##Story

* [*A Person Known to Me*](http://www.apersonknowntome.com): A digital dime novel -- an ongoing, epic, multi-installment detective adventure that includes prose, movies, historical context, and illustrations by the wonderful Kati Simon.

* A non-fiction account of the final eleven days of my mother's life. Alec has dubbed this project my "momoir."

* "Urban Bird" - A short story about pigeons.

* *The Mesopotamia* - A series of short fiction pieces set in a 1920s Chicago movie palace, to be presented online in the form of an interactive website.

* Reading. Here's my <a href="../books/">current list</a>.

* Writing classes:
  * [Memoir Boot Camp](http://www.literary-arts.org/product/winter-2016-memoir-boot-camp/) with Jay Ponteri at Portland's Literary Arts.
  * Creative Writing (Fiction) with Blake Hausman at Portland Community College.
  * [Writing a Novel in 8 Weeks](http://www.literary-arts.org/product/winter-2016-writing-a-novel-in-8-weeks/) with Emily Chenoweth at Literary Arts.

And, as part of my story explorations, I'm also looking into:

* Digital Narratives
* Literary apps
* Story design
* Book design
* Color
* Typography
    
##Coding
    
Having started my web development education with Al Zimmerman at the late Portland Code School, I'm now continuing on my own, following <a href="../codingCurriculum/">this (constantly evolving) self-designed curriculum</a>.

* I'm supplementing that with coursework from [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/). (Right now, Front End Web Development: CSS Layout Basics.)
    
* I'm transcribing all my notes from the classes I took at Portland Code School and posting them <a href="../pcsnotes/">here</a>.

##Angel Investing
    
* I'm evaluating and investing in for-profit social ventures founded and run by women.  My first two investments, done through the bootcamp program run by [Pipeline Angels](http://pipelineangels.com/), are:

I've also collected some of the angel investing resources and tools I've found [here](http://stephanieargy.github.io/AngelInvesting/).


##Other Things

* Learning to speak Greek, learning about Greece. (Finding it very useful to work with the [Anki spaced repetition system](http://ankisrs.net/).)

* Learning to be part of the [Portland Neightborhood Emergency Team program](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/pbem/31667?).
