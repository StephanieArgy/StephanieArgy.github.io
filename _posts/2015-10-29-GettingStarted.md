I'm trying to figure out the best way to launch a simple, responsive mobile-first HTML5 site. I've built from scratch, used HTML Boilerplate, Bootstrap, Yeoman.  Now what? How can I avoid constantly redoing set-up tasks, without inviting in some klunky infrastructure with lots of elements that I don't need? My own code? Some sort of scaffolding? Template? Framework? My focus at the moment is on mobile-first design, so what are my options?

##Write own code

* Nice beginner's guide here: [http://websitesetup.org/html5-beginners-guide/](http://websitesetup.org/html5-beginners-guide/).
* And a more complex tutorial here: [http://www.lingulo.com/tutorials/css/how-to-build-a-html5-website-from-scratch](http://www.lingulo.com/tutorials/css/how-to-build-a-html5-website-from-scratch).
