title: Why This Blog?

#

I initially started this blog as a way to:

1.  Learn Jekyll and Markdown.
2.  Have a place to post all my <a href="../pcsnotes/">notes from the classes that I took at Portland Code School in 2015</a>. 

But immediately, I realized that this could be a dandy way to keep myself on track as I refine what I'm doing as a writer, and as a developer, and as whatever it is that one becomes at the crossroads of the two.

So here goes.
