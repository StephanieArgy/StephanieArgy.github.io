title: Why This Blog?
---

#

I initially started this blog as a way to: 
1. Learn Jekyll and Markdown.
2. Have a place to post all my <a href="../pcsnotes/">notes from the classes that I took at Portland Code School in 2015</a>. 

But immediately, I realized that this could be a dandy way to keep myself on track as I refine what I'm doing as a writer, and as a developer, and as whatever it is that one becomes at the crossroads of the two.

When we lived in Los Angeles, we had a wonderful studio with concrete floors and a drain in the floor and a massive work sink, and I fell in love with it as first sight, because I thought, "Here's a place where we don't have to be afraid to make a mess!" Now, in our new studio in Portland, we've plunged deep into words and pictures and sounds and pieces of text. So this little site will be our new place to get messy: hence...Muddy Hands.
