title: Inverting My Learning Process
---

My goal in learning web development has been to find a way to use these tools to build visual, interactive narratives that can incorporate multiple storytelling forms -- prose, illustrations, movies, etc. -- in one fun, seamless experience.

This morning, I realized that I have the process upside down. When I started learning web development, it made sense to start with the tools and technologies, so that's what I've been doing. And perhaps that was the right way to begin, but today, I realized that the time has come for me to let story and design drive my learning process, and have the web development tools serve them, rather than the other way around. 

I'm striving for a combination of:

* **STORY - Why?**
* **DESIGN - What?**
* **TOOLS - How?**

**And in that order**. Start with the story (or with an emotion to be conveyed or provoked). Next, figure out how to design that experience. Then, finally, figure out the tools necessary to put it all together.

In learning or teaching coding, is it possible to start from that perspective? To begin by asking: "What are we trying to express, convey, make the person on the other end of the interaction feel emotionally?"

I began my explorations today by thinking about different arts: animation, architecture, cinema, illustration, painting, performing arts, photography, printmaking, sculpture, sequential art, sound design, writing.

**What do they do?**

* They provide an experience.
* They provoke an emotion (cathartic, vicarious - or personal and visceral?)
* They take the viewer/reader/listener to a place/time/situation they couldn't go on their own.

How do we conceive and start a web project with that kind of impetus? Can we move this form into something deeper and more artistic? Not a container for other arts, but an artform in itself?

That's my challenge to myself...
