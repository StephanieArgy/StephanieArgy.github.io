title: My Coding Curriculum
---

My focus at the moment is on getting myself solid with the fundamental web building blocks: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery, as used in responsive, mobile-first sites and apps. This is a preliminary overall curriculum that I'm devising for myself (subject to constant revision, on probably a daily basis):

##HTML

###Subjects to Cover:

* Semantic markup (especially all the HTML5 tags)
* Forms
* Audio and video
* Canvas
* Web storage
* Geolocation
* Web workers

###Projects:

* Make an HTML sampler, using every tag I can think of (and keep that to use as the basis for future style guides)

##CSS

###Subjects to Cover:

* Selectors
* Layout quirks with floats, etc.
* Gradients
* Border images
* Flexbox
* Transitions and transformations
* Animation
* Fancy fonts - Google Fonts, @fontface.
* Sass

###Projects:

* Create a responsive site with border images

##JavaScript/jQuery

I'm combining these, because I think I need to learn them simultaneously: JavaScript, slowly and with patience, to build up a deep understanding of the underlying principles, and jQuery, so that I can make things that work from the very beginning.

###Projects

* Make a lightbox
* Make a photo gallery
* Make a simple drawing application
* Make a site the style and content of which changes depending on the time of day someone visits.

##Reponsive/Mobile-First Design

###Subjects to Cover:

* Media queries
* Responsive images
* Mobile devices and touch
* Start-up images and icons

##Best Practices, Testing and Debugging
