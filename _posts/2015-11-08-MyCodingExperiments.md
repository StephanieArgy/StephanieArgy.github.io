title: Coding Goals v.1

My focus at the moment is on getting myself solid with the fundamental web building blocks: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery, as used in responsive, mobile-first sites and apps.

This is a preliminary overall plan that I'm devising for myself. It's not an exhaustive list of what a person should learn to become a developer, but rather a plan to remedy gaps and shaky spots in my own knowledge:

##HTML

* Semantic markup (especially all the HTML5 tags) - *Make an HTML sampler, using every tag I can think of (and keep that to use as the basis for future style guides)*
* Forms
* Audio and video
* Canvas
* Web storage
* Geolocation
* Web workers


##CSS

* Selectors
* Layout quirks with floats, etc.
* Gradients
* Border images
* Flexbox
* CSS Shapes
* Transitions and transformations
* Animation
* Fancy fonts - Google Fonts, @fontface.
* Sass


##JavaScript/jQuery

I'm combining these, because I think I need to learn them simultaneously: JavaScript, slowly and with patience, to build up a deep understanding of the underlying principles, and jQuery, so that I can make things that work from the very beginning.

* Make a lightbox
* Make a photo gallery
* Make a simple drawing application
* Make a site the style and content of which changes depending on the time of day someone visits.

##Reponsive/Mobile-First Design

* Media queries
* Responsive images
* Mobile devices and touch
* Start-up images and icons

##Best Practices, Testing and Debugging
