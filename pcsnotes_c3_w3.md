##Scaffolding with Yeoman (and friends)(by Jaime Panaia)

Going to build a web app using the Yeoman scaffolding. What we'll do:

1. Scaffold an app using only a few commands for Yeoman.
2. Use Grunt to customize tasks (live reloads)
3. Customize a Sass file.

**Yeoman: [http://yeoman.io/](http://yeoman.io/)

Doesn't work on its own.  Need:

1. **yo webapp** -- Command to create a new web app.
2. bower search, bower install (to handle dependencies)
3. grunt serve, grunt test -- To preview, test and build.

To install yo, bower and grunt: **$ npm install -g yo bower grunt -cli**

(May need to use sudo to get them to install.)
