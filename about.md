My name is Stephanie Argy, and I'm a writer and filmmaker, learning to use web development technologies as a medium of artistic storytelling. I live and work with Alec Boehm in Portland, Oregon, where we have two cats, Natasha the Adventuress and Capt. Virgil Hilts (The Cooler King).

Alec and I used to live in Los Angeles, where we had a wonderful studio with concrete floors, a drain in the floor and a massive work sink. I fell in love with that studio at first sight, because I thought, "Here's a place where we don't have to be afraid to make a mess!" Now, here in Portland, we've plunged deep into words and pictures and sounds and little chunks of text, and so we need a different kind of place in which to make a mess. I've created this website to chronicle the grimy, hands-on experiments of my writing and coding education -- hence...Muddy Hands.

My other goal with this site is to use it a home for my (very in-depth) notes from the Web Foundations and Advanced Front End Web Dev Tools courses that I took at Portland Code School. After the school abruptly went out of business in October 2015, it occurred to me that my notes might be of use to others...so I'm housing them <a href="../pcsnotes/">here</a>.

And finally, here's a list of the things that I'm doing <a href="../now/">right now</a>.
