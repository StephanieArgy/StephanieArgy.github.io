My name is Stephanie Argy, and I'm a writer and filmmaker who uses web development technologies as a form of storytelling. This is a website on which I'm chronicling the grimy, hands-on experiments of my coding education. Hence..."muddy hands," which is what I try to get through all this. (Daintier, more philosophical musings on story, design and tools can be found at [www.StephanieArgy.com](http://www.stephanieargy.com).
