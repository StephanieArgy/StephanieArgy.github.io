My name is Stephanie Argy, and I'm a writer and filmmaker who is learning to use web development technologies as a medium of storytelling. I live and work with Alec Boehm. He and I are based in Portland, and we have two cats, Natasha the Adventuress and Capt. Virgil Hilts (The Cooler King).

This is a website on which I'm chronicling the grimy, hands-on experiments of my coding education. Alec and I used to live in Los Angeles, where we had a wonderful studio with concrete floors and a drain in the floor and a massive work sink. I fell in love with that studio at first sight, because I thought, "Here's a place where we don't have to be afraid to make a mess!" Now, in our new studio in Portland, we've plunged deep into words and pictures and sounds and pieces of text. This little site will be our new place to get messy: hence...Muddy Hands.

My other goal with this site is to use it a home for all of my (very in-depth) notes from the Web Foundations and Advanced Front End Web Dev Tools courses that I took at Portland Code School. After the school abruptly went out of business in October 2015, it occurred to me that my notes might be of use to others...so I'm housing them <a href="../pcsnotes/">here</a>.

And finally, here's a list of the things that I'm doing <a href="../now/">right now</a>.
