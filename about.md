My name is Stephanie Argy, and I'm a writer and filmmaker who is learning to use web development technologies as a form of storytelling. This is a website on which I'm chronicling the grimy, hands-on experiments of my coding education. Hence..."muddy hands," which is what I'm trying to get as I go through all this. 

My other goal with this site is to use it a home for all of my (very thorough!) notes from the Web Foundations and Advanced Front End Web Dev Tools courses that I took at Portland Code School. After the school abruptly went out of business in October 2015, it occurred to me that my notes might be of use to others...so I'm stashing them <a href='{{ pcsnotes }}'>here</a>.

Here's a list of the things that I'm doing <a href='{{ now }}'>now</a>.
