##Web Foundations: Primer Basic
###Week 1

####Class Tools

* Slack: For class and team communcation. *(By end of first day, install Slack on computer and iPhone.)*
* Chrome: Our browser of choice for the purposes of this class.
* Codepen.io: A playpen for experiments wtih HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* Git and GitHub.com: Project versioning and online repositories.
* Atom or Sublime: Text editors for writing code. *(Later, I switched to Brackets, which I like most of all)*
* Terminal/Gitbash: For command-line interactions.

####Learning to Learn

Throughout course, keep a growing list of vocabulary terms; define them, then post them online in a <a href="../pcsnotes_glossary/">glossary</a> we will make for ourselves.

This is a code school, so we are of course concerned with technology, but we are also concerned with teamwork, including **pair programming**.

The first thing we need to learn is the process of learning.  One method we will use in class (and on our own) is the **pomodoro technique.**  Named after the Italian tomato-shaped kitchen timer.  Idea is to help us focus better: we make a deal to focus entirely on one task for 25 minutes (then take a break). (Very important to get up and move around; there are two major occupational hazards of programming - heart disease, from too much sitting, and carpal tunnel syndrome/repetitive stress injury.)

We need to take control of our learning process and to find what works for us, and what needs practice. 

For homework:
1. Read <a href=http://www.innovationexcellence.com/blog/2014/10/16/25-things-skilled-learners-do-differently/>"25 Things Skilled Learners Do Differently"</a> by Saga Briggs, then pick one (or more) of those techniques to practice.
2. Finish the Treehouse course "How to Make a Website." (Take the quizzes first, and if you pass, skip the lessons and move on.)

Plan on spending 4-5 hours of the next 48 on class work.

Also fill out survey. (Don't look up anything for THIS quiz; on others, you can use reference materials, but this is to get a baseline of what people know.)

To learn, have to work on memory. Three languages to learn, each with its own syntax. Techniques to help process:
1. Make flashcards. (You have to make them yourself and keep them with you.)
2. Take notes by hand. (Draw pictures, too. As primates, we're good at visualizing, so pictures help.)

We also have to have work on some particular skills (or un-suppress abilities we may already have): 
ATTENTION TO DETAIL: Have to be able to read for detail, see every character in the code.

Going to use Git. Git sucks. We will interact with it on the command line.

Having a question you need to answer gives you a goal. If there are questions, try Slack (teachers and classmates), as well as Stack Overflow.
