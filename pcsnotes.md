title: Portland Code School Class Notes
permalink: /pcsnotes/

On the weekend of October 16, 2015, Portland Code School abruptly went out of business.

I had started at the school as a student in March, 2015, and after I finished three courses (Primer Basic, Primer Pro and Advanced Front End Dev Tools), I started working as a TA in the next three rounds of those same classes.

As someone trained as a journalist, I'm very good at taking notes. When I was a student, I wrote down everything that we did in class...and then as a TA, I kept adding to my notes, paying special attention to the things that had most confused me, and that seemed to be confusing to other students. (There are a lot of notes, so this will be a project that I work on over time...)

Here's the basic framework: 

##Primer Basic

####<a href="../pcsnotes_c1_w1/">Week One</a> - Learning to Learn, Short Overview of How a Website Works, Making Our First Website, Language Basics, Command Line Basics, Making a Webpage in a Text Editor

####<a href="../pcsnotes_c1_w2/">Week Two</a> - Agile Project Management, Git and GitHub Basics, Chrome Developer Tools, CSS Positioning

####<a href="../pcsnotes_c1_w3/">Week Three</a> - Collaborating with Git and GitHub

####<a href="../pcsnotes_c1_w4/">Week Four</a> - Forms, final presentations

##Primer Pro

####<a href="../pcsnotes_c2_w2/">Week Two</a> - Responsive design, reponsive images, developer tools for JavaScript, responsive design assignment, preview of JavaScript Immersion course

####<a href="../pcsnotes_c2_w3/">Week Three</a> - Introduction to Bootstrap

##Advanced Front End Dev Tools

####Week Two - Scaffolding tools such as Yeoman, task automation, autoprefixers

####Week Three - User stories, style guides

In addition, I made myself a page of assorted links and resources that helped me with the curriculum. That page can be found here:   http://stephanieargy.github.io/journal/
