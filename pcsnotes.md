title: Portland Code School Class Notes
permalink: /pcsnotes/

On the weekend of October 16, 2015, Portland Code School abruptly went out of business.

I had started at the school as a student in March, 2015, and after I finished three courses (Primer Basic, Primer Pro and Advanced Front End Dev Tools), I started working as a TA in the next three rounds of those same classes.

As someone trained as a journalist, I'm very good at taking notes. When I was a student, I wrote down everything that we did in class...and then as a TA, I kept adding to my notes, paying special attention to the things that had most confused me, and that seemed to be confusing to other students. There are a lot of notes, so this will be a project that I work on over time...

Here's the basic framework: 

##Primer Basic

###<a href="../pcsnotes_c1_w1/">Week One</a> - HTML, CSS, command-line, Git

###Week Two - GitHub, CSS positioning and Flexbox

###Week Three - Chrome Developer Tools and collaborating with Git and GitHub

###Week Four - Teamwork and working with clients

##Primer Pro

###Week One - Mobile-first and responsive design

###Week Two - Introduction to JavaScript and jQuery

###Week Three - Introduction to Bootstrap

###Week Four - More Bootstrap

##Advanced Front End Dev Tools

###Week One - Command-line review, task runners, Sass

###Week Two - Scaffolding tools such as Yeoman, task automation, autoprefixers

###Week Three - User stories, style guides

###Week Four - Forms, testing with Selenium
