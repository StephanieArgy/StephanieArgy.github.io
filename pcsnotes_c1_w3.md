###Week 3

* [Collaborating Using Git](#git_collaboration)




Going to do teamwork tonight.  Tonight's assignments:

1. Chrome Developer Tools Scavenger Hunt
2. Journal (ongoing)
3. Start of a website for a client.

Normally, when you interact with a client, they specify what they want. From their guidelines, you create a **client brief**, and then a **wireframe.**  And so, we're going to take a client brief and wireframe and code them up.

Because we'll be working as teams, we have to figure out how to collectively edit files that have different people working on them at the same time. The challlenges:

1. Communcation at a distance.
2. Collaboration on editing: 

  * If you're good at this, you can see what everyone else is doing, and...
  * You won't step on each other.
  
For this assignment, we're going to use a project management site. There are many, but we're going to use [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), which has To Do lists, discussions, etc.

(If you don't log out of Facebook, Google, Amazon, IMDB, they're tracking every site you visit.)

We learn well by association, and by seeing two things at the same time. [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses), famed statistician and artist, said that important things need to be within your eyescan.  **You want to have code and its effect visible at the same time; if you continue in this field, invest in more monitors.**
